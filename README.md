# KWIC Tutorial
This is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) project. You need to install Maven first before coding.

This project was developed with **Java 8**. Make sure you have appropriate [SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed on your machine.

## Install Maven
Maven is a build manager for Java projects. It helps you to install Java libraries, automate the project build process and manage your Java project.

Install Maven on:
* Mac: as simple as `$ brew install maven` (in case you don't know what is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you should use it now).
* Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt-get install maven`
* Windows: refer to this [guide](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)

## Import project to Eclipse IDE
After installing Maven, you should be able to Import the project into the Eclipse workspace by choosing "Import" -> "Maven" -> "Existing Maven project". Select the path to the `pom.xml` file of your project and click "Finish". The Eclipse IDE should be able to automatically install project dependencies if Maven is properly installed.

Refer to [this guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2061094/importing-maven-project-into-eclipse) if you meet any issues for importing.

## Run the project
You can run the program from [App.java](https://github.com/Gisonrg-in-NUS/KWIC-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/sg/edu/nus/comp/cs3219/App.java).
